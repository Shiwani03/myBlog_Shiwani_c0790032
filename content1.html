      <p class="image-p"><img src="./images/food8.jpg" style="border-radius: 10px;" alt="Demo Image" />
       Tofu is a truly versatile ingredient, light on flavor but in the best way. It soaks up whatever flavors you cleverly pair it with, from spicy to salty to sweet to tart. Treat it as a wonderfully textured blank canvas, grilling, frying, and baking firm tofu as a stand-in for meat or puréeing silken tofu as a stand-in for dairy or eggs. In our favorite tofu recipes, however, this wonderful block of soy isn’t simply a stand-in—it’s a star. Try these dishes that feature tofu as a headline ingredient. <br>
       Citrus Ginger Tofu Salad With Buckwheat Soba Noodles: Marinated and baked tofu is tossed with chewy soba noodles and crunchy fresh vegetables like cabbage and kale for a lunchtime dream. The remaining marinade is repurposed and brightened with a little orange juice to make a light but vibrant dressing. Lentil Meatballs With Indian Fenugreek Sauce: Vegan food isn’t all rabbit food—it can be warming and hearty and downright cozy. Case in point, these vegan and gluten-free “meatballs” made with lentils, quinoa, and tofu doused in coconut milk and turmeric sauce.

      Maybe you’ve heard that tofu is healthy, but you don’t have the first idea what to do with it. Or maybe you crave chicken and steak on the regular and think tofu is for people who’ve totally eschewed animal foods. No matter why you’ve shied away from tofu in the past, there are lots of reasons to put it on the menu. Tofu, a traditional Asian food made from coagulated soybeans, is a major protein source for many vegetarians and vegans. But people who eat animal foods also use it as a healthier replacement for meat or dairy. And since it’s quite inexpensive, easy to cook with, and packs a ton of health benefits, it’s an excellent addition to your meal plans. <br> <br>  If you’re new to tofu, it’s normal to find its texture and flavor intimidating. Give it a shot anyway: Nutritionists say tofu is extremely versatile, since it can be used in sweet and salty dishes and soaks up any flavor you add to it.

      When plant-based nutritionist Alexandra Caspero, R.D., first started cooking with tofu, she didn't know what to do with it. But now? “It’s almost foolproof. It’s an inexpensive way to stretch your dishes and add healthy, lower-fat protein for few calories.”
      
      Beyond being good for weight management, tofu may confer a few other health benefits. All soy foods, including tofu, contain isoflavones, which act like weak estrogens in the body. Since high levels of estrogens are linked to some hormonal cancers, this raised concerns in the past that soy might increase the risk of certain cancers, especially breast cancer. However, the research to-date suggests that tofu and other whole soy foods may actually have the opposite effect and offer other health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease.
      
      Read on to learn more on what tofu is, how it’s made, and what science has to say about the health benefits of eating tofu.
